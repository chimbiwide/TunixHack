The occurrence of externalities is the major reason behind government intervention in the monetary sphere. When the government intervenes, it charges the negative externalities through regulations or application of market-anchored strategies, for instance, taxes. If the government does not intervene, polluters make decisions anchored just in the direct expenses of and profit opportunity from manufacturing without considering the indirect outlays to the people affected by the pollution. These indirect outlays encompass poor quality of life, for instance, a homeowner residing close to a smokestack, increased medical costs, disregarded production opportunities, and the impact of pollution on practices such as tourism. Attributable to the indirect outlays not being incurred by the polluter, they are not passed on to the consumer, which makes the total or social costs of production greater when compared to private costs.'}]"
